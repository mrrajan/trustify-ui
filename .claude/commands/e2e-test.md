description: Create E2E test in e2e/tests/ui
argument-hint: Test summary
---

## Context

Parse $ARGUMENTS to get the following values:

- [summary]: Test summary from $ARGUMENTS

## Task

Create E2E Playwright tests based on [summary] and following these guidelines:

- Tests are written under `e2e/tests/ui`

## Review the work

- **Invoke the e2e-test-reviewer subagent** to review your work and implement
  suggestions where needed
- Iterate on the review process when needed

## Execute the work

- Execute the generated tests using the command below:

```bash
# Run a single e2e test file (ALWAYS use this format)
SKIP_INGESTION=true TRUSTIFY_UI_URL=http://localhost:3000 PW_TEST_CONNECT_WS_ENDPOINT=ws://localhost:5000/ npm run e2e:test -- path/to/test.test.ts --workers=2 --trace on
```

- Iterate to make the tests pass successfully when needed
  - Limit to 2-3 iterations maximum. Let the developer do the refinement manually
    when needed. Always suggest possible polishing actions so the human can take
    action
